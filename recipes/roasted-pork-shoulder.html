        <h2>Roasted pork shoulder is a flavorful cut of meat, slow-cooked to tender perfection with a crispy, caramelized exterior and juicy, savory interior.</h2>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons chopped garlic</li>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 (4 pound) pork shoulder</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix together the olive oil, garlic, salt and pepper. Using a pastry brush, spread the mixture all over the pork shoulder.</li>
            <li>Set the meat on a rack set into a roasting pan. Roast for 20 minutes, and then reduce the heat to 325 degrees F. Continue to cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the shoulder reads 185 degrees F, about 4 hours. Remove the pork from the oven and let stand until cool enough to handle, about 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
